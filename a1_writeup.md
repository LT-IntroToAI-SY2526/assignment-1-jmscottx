# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

My initial experience with Python was this assingment. It is similar to JavaScript with some of the functions, and I'm already familiar with deifning and initializing variables and loops, so this wasn't too complicated compared to JavaScript.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I used AI effectively to help me when I got stuck during coding. Prompts like "I dont understand why we do "this" can you explain? helped me a lot.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

The concepts of asserting was probably the most complicated and identation as I always struggled with it during CSP. AI helped by explaining a trick to remember where to indent.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
Asking for examples, tricks, and memorable things to help me worked best for learning. Without simply giving me the answers, AI helped more as a teacher and a mentor.
